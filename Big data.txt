5 Big data problems: 

Ingestion,
Storage,
Processing,
Analysis,
Exploration

5 V's of big data:

Diff. b/w big data and data science


HADOOP:

Named by Doug Cuting
Kernel of big data
Free framework: apache.hadoop.org
Scalabale horizontally
Fault tolerant
Commodity hardware (readily available)
No low level programming
Distributed system

Vendors: Cloudera, Hortonworks, MApR, Infosys, IBM, Intel, Microsoft


Logical Architecture: hollistic view

Single Node architecture:

Hardware--> OS--> --> JRE--> Storage --> Processing --> ANalysis/ Ingestion --> Exploration


NoSQL (not Only SQL)-->
Thease are for specialized use-cases, ex:

graphs,
Key-values,
document storage,-- > Mongo DB :  Flexible Schema, GeoSpatial queries (Polyglot persistence-- on youtube)
                      Elastic search: More languages
search    --->  solar, elastic search
colonar --> HBase


Row-oriented DBs: 

HBase: Hadoop database: colronal db: random read write


HDFS vs HBase:

File system   ------   No SQL DB
Sequential access ----  Randowm read-write
No updates allowed (append is allowed) 



Processing frameworks: Map reduce, spark
